# Elytra Auto-Flight 1.17

This is a fork of Simonlourson's client auto flight mod, updated for 1.17 and added /flyto command functionality.

## How to use

Press the assigned key (default "R") to enable "Auto Flight". While in Auto Flight mode, the mod will modify your pitch between going up and down, resulting in net altitude gain.

## /flyto command
Syntax: /flyto Xpos Zpos

While in Auto Flight mode, input this command to automatically fly to the set coordinates. When near the location, the mod will try to slow you down by rotating around the target to avoid fall damage. This can be deactivated at any time by turning off Auto Flight or with the toggle in the config.
