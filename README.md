# Elytra AutoPilot 1.17

**This mod requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).**
***
This is a fork of Simonlourson's client [auto-flight mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elytra-auto-flight), updated for 1.17 and added /flyto command functionality.


## How to use

Press the assigned key (default "R") while flying to enable 'Auto Flight'. While in Auto Flight mode, the mod will modify your pitch between going up and down, resulting in net altitude gain.

## */flyto* command
>Syntax: */flyto Xpos Zpos*

While in 'Auto Flight' mode, input this command to automatically fly to the set coordinates. When near the location, the mod will try to slow you down by rotating around the target to avoid fall damage. This can be deactivated at any time by turning off Auto Flight or using the toggle in the config.
